 * This class implements the HashTrieMap data structure
 * which is just a type of Trie. Its purpose is to make
 * it incredibly fast and easy to look up words, and to
 * check for the existence of prefixes for any given words.
 * Each node in this trie is its own HashMap, that either stores
 * values or points to another node further down the trie.
 * Nodes that contain values are typically considered the last
 * node in the trie, which is how it is determined that the end
 * of the trie has been reached.
 *
 * The removal method for this class utilizes recursive backtracking
 * to systematically remove each node in the branch until all necessary
 * conditions have been satisfiedâ€“essentially when the entire branch has been
 * removed, and the offending word no longer appears inside the trie.
